        <p>In this post I present the development model that I’ve introduced for all of my projects (both at work and private) about a year<br>ago, and which has turned out to be very successful. I’ve been meaning to write about it for a while now, but I’ve never really<br>found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I won’t talk about any of the projects’ details, merely about the branching<br>strategy and release management.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<img src="/images/git/Screen-shot-2009-12-24-at-11.32.03.png" class="center">
<p>It focuses around <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Git</a> as the tool for the versioning of all of our source code.</p>
<h2 id="Why-git"><a href="#Why-git" class="headerlink" title="Why git?"></a>Why git?</h2><p>For a thorough discussion on the pros and cons of Git compared to centralized source code control systems, <a href="http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">see</a> the <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSvnComparsion" target="_blank" rel="external">web</a>. There are<br>plenty of flame wars going on there. As a developer, I prefer Git above all other tools around today. Git really changed the way<br>developers think of merging and branching. From the classic CVS/Subversion world I came from, merging/branching has always been<br>considered a bit scary (“beware of merge conflicts, they bite you!”) and something you only do every once in a while.</p>
<p>But with Git, these actions are extremely cheap and simple, and they are considered one of the core parts of your daily workflow,<br>really. For example, in CVS/Subversion <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com" target="_blank" rel="external">books</a>, branching and merging is first discussed in the later chapters (for advanced users),<br>while in <a href="http://book.git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="external">every</a> <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git" target="_blank" rel="external">Git</a> <a href="http://github.com/progit/progit" target="_blank" rel="external">book</a>, it’s already covered in chapter 3 (basics).</p>
<p>As a consequence of its simplicity and repetitive nature, branching and merging are no longer something to be afraid of. Version<br>control tools are supposed to assist in branching/merging more than anything else.</p>
<p>Enough about the tools, let’s head onto the development model. The model that I’m going to present here is essentially no more<br>than a set of procedures that every team member has to follow in order to come to a managed software development process.</p>
<h2 id="Decentralized-but-centralized"><a href="#Decentralized-but-centralized" class="headerlink" title="Decentralized but centralized"></a>Decentralized but centralized</h2><p>The repository setup that we use and that works well with this branching model, is that with a central “truth” repo. Note that<br>this repo is only considered to be the central one (since Git is a DVCS, there is no such thing as a central repo at a technical<br>level). We will refer to this repo as origin, since this name is familiar to all Git users.</p>
<img src="/images/git/centr-decentr.png" class="center">
<p>Each developer pulls and pushes to origin. But besides the centralized push-pull relationships, each developer may also pull<br>changes from other peers to form sub teams. For example, this might be useful to work together with two or more developers on a<br>big new feature, before pushing the work in progress to origin prematurely. In the figure above, there are subteams of Alice and<br>Bob, Alice and David, and Clair and David.</p>
<p>Technically, this means nothing more than that Alice has defined a Git remote, named bob, pointing to Bob’s repository, and vice<br>versa.</p>
<h2 id="The-main-branches"><a href="#The-main-branches" class="headerlink" title="The main branches"></a>The main branches</h2><img src="/images/git/bm002.png" class="right">
<p>At the core, the development model is greatly inspired by existing models out there. The central repo holds two main branches with<br>an infinite lifetime:</p>
<ul>
<li>master</li>
<li>develop</li>
</ul>
<p>The master branch at origin should be familiar to every Git user. Parallel to the master branch, another branch exists called<br>develop.</p>
<p>We consider origin/master to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.</p>
<p>We consider origin/develop to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered<br>development changes for the next release. Some would call this the “integration branch”. This is where any automatic nightly<br>builds are built from.</p>
<p>When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged<br>back into master somehow and then tagged with a release number. How this is done in detail will be discussed further on.</p>
<p>Therefore, each time when changes are merged back into master, this is a new production release by definition. We tend to be very<br>strict at this, so that theoretically, we could use a Git hook script to automatically build and roll-out our software to our<br>production servers everytime there was a commit on master.</p>
<h2 id="Supporting-branches"><a href="#Supporting-branches" class="headerlink" title="Supporting branches"></a>Supporting branches</h2><p>Next to the main branches master and develop, our development model uses a variety of supporting branches to aid parallel<br>development between team members, ease tracking of features, prepare for production releases and to assist in quickly fixing live<br>production problems. Unlike the main branches, these branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed<br>eventually.</p>
<p>The different types of branches we may use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature branches</li>
<li>Release branches</li>
<li>Hotfix branches</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these branches have a specific purpose and are bound to strict rules as to which branches may be their originating branch<br>and which branches must be their merge targets. We will walk through them in a minute.</p>
<p>By no means are these branches “special” from a technical perspective. The branch types are categorized by how we use them. They<br>are of course plain old Git branches.</p>
<h3 id="Feature-branches"><a href="#Feature-branches" class="headerlink" title="Feature branches"></a>Feature branches</h3><img src="/images/git/fb.png" class="right">
<p>May branch off from: develop<br>Must merge back into: develop<br>Branch naming convention: anything except master, develop, release-*, or hotfix-*</p>
<p>Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future<br>release. When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown<br>at that point. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be<br>merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing<br>experiment).</p>
<p>Feature branches typically exist in developer repos only, not in origin.</p>
<h4 id="Creating-a-feature-branch"><a href="#Creating-a-feature-branch" class="headerlink" title="Creating a feature branch"></a>Creating a feature branch</h4><p>When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the develop branch.</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout -b myfeature develop<br>Switched to a new branch “myfeature”<br></code></p>
<h4 id="Incorporating-a-finished-feature-on-develop"><a href="#Incorporating-a-finished-feature-on-develop" class="headerlink" title="Incorporating a finished feature on develop"></a>Incorporating a finished feature on develop</h4><p>Finished features may be merged into the develop branch definitely add them to the upcoming release:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout develop<br>Switched to branch ‘develop’<br>$ git merge –no-ff myfeature<br>Updating ea1b82a..05e9557<br>(Summary of changes)<br>$ git branch -d myfeature<br>Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557).<br>$ git push origin develop<br></code></p>
<p>The –no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward.<br>This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together<br>added the feature. Compare:</p>
<img src="/images/git/merge-without-ff.png" class="center">
<p>In the latter case, it is impossible to see from the Git history which of the commit objects together have implemented a<br>feature—you would have to manually read all the log messages. Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), is a true<br>headache in the latter situation, whereas it is easily done if the –no-ff flag was used.</p>
<p>Yes, it will create a few more (empty) commit objects, but the gain is much bigger that that cost.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have not found a way to make –no-ff the default behaviour of git merge yet, but it really should be.</p>
<h3 id="Release-branches"><a href="#Release-branches" class="headerlink" title="Release branches"></a>Release branches</h3><p>May branch off from: develop<br>Must merge back into: develop and master<br>Branch naming convention: release-*</p>
<p>Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i’s and crossing t’s.<br>Furthermore, they allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). By doing<br>all of this work on a release branch, the develop branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.</p>
<p>The key moment to branch off a new release branch from develop is when develop (almost) reflects the desired state of the new<br>release. At least all features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time.<br>All features targeted at future releases may not—they must wait until after the release branch is branched off.</p>
<p>It is exactly at the start of a release branch that the upcoming release gets assigned a version number—not any earlier. Up until<br>that moment, the develop branch reflected changes for the “next release”, but it is unclear whether that “next release” will<br>eventually become 0.3 or 1.0, until the release branch is started. That decision is made on the start of the release branch and is<br>carried out by the project’s rules on version number bumping.</p>
<h4 id="Creating-a-release-branch"><a href="#Creating-a-release-branch" class="headerlink" title="Creating a release branch"></a>Creating a release branch</h4><p>Release branches are created from the develop branch. For example, say version 1.1.5 is the current production release and we have<br>a big release coming up. The state of develop is ready for the “next release” and we have decided that this will become version<br>1.2 (rather than 1.1.6 or 2.0). So we branch off and give the release branch a name reflecting the new version number:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout -b release-1.2 develop<br>Switched to a new branch “release-1.2”<br>$ ./bump-version.sh 1.2<br>Files modified successfully, version bumped to 1.2.<br>$ git commit -a -m “Bumped version number to 1.2”<br>[release-1.2 74d9424] Bumped version number to 1.2<br>1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)<br></code></p>
<p>After creating a new branch and switching to it, we bump the version number. Here, bump-version.sh is a fictional shell script<br>that changes some files in the working copy to reflect the new version. (This can of course be a manual change—the point being<br>that some files change.) Then, the bumped version number is committed.</p>
<p>This new branch may exist there for a while, until the release may be rolled out definitely. During that time, bug fixes may be<br>applied in this branch (rather than on the develop branch). Adding large new features here is strictly prohibited. They must be<br>merged into develop, and therefore, wait for the next big release.</p>
<h4 id="Finishing-a-release-branch"><a href="#Finishing-a-release-branch" class="headerlink" title="Finishing a release branch"></a>Finishing a release branch</h4><p>When the state of the release branch is ready to become a real release, some actions need to be carried out. First, the release<br>branch is merged into master (since every commit on master is a new release by definition, remember). Next, that commit on master<br>must be tagged for easy future reference to this historical version. Finally, the changes made on the release branch need to be<br>merged back into develop, so that future releases also contain these bug fixes.</p>
<p>The first two steps in Git:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout master<br>Switched to branch ‘master’<br>$ git merge –no-ff release-1.2<br>Merge made by recursive.<br>(Summary of changes)<br>$ git tag -a 1.2<br></code></p>
<p>The release is now done, and tagged for future reference.<br>Edit: You might as well want to use the -s or -u <key> flags to sign your tag cryptographically.</key></p>
<p>To keep the changes made in the release branch, we need to merge those back into develop, though. In Git:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout develop<br>Switched to branch ‘develop’<br>$ git merge –no-ff release-1.2<br>Merge made by recursive.<br>(Summary of changes)<br></code></p>
<p>This step may well lead to a merge conflict (probably even, since we have changed the version number). If so, fix it and commit.</p>
<p>Now we are really done and the release branch may be removed, since we don’t need it anymore:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git branch -d release-1.2<br>Deleted branch release-1.2 (was ff452fe).<br></code></p>
<h3 id="Hotfix-branches"><a href="#Hotfix-branches" class="headerlink" title="Hotfix branches"></a>Hotfix branches</h3><img src="/images/git/hotfix-branches1.png" class="right">
<p>May branch off from: master<br>Must merge back into: develop and master<br>Branch naming convention: hotfix-*</p>
<p>Hotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit<br>unplanned. They arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. When a critical<br>bug in a production version must be resolved immediately, a hotfix branch may be branched off from the corresponding tag on the<br>master branch that marks the production version.</p>
<p>The essence is that work of team members (on the develop branch) can continue, while another person is preparing a quick<br>production fix.</p>
<h4 id="Creating-the-hotfix-branch"><a href="#Creating-the-hotfix-branch" class="headerlink" title="Creating the hotfix branch"></a>Creating the hotfix branch</h4><p>Hotfix branches are created from the master branch. For example, say version 1.2 is the current production release running live<br>and causing troubles due to a severe bug. But changes on develop are yet unstable. We may then branch off a hotfix branch and<br>start fixing the problem:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 master<br>Switched to a new branch “hotfix-1.2.1”<br>$ ./bump-version.sh 1.2.1<br>Files modified successfully, version bumped to 1.2.1.<br>$ git commit -a -m “Bumped version number to 1.2.1”<br>[hotfix-1.2.1 41e61bb] Bumped version number to 1.2.1<br>1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)<br></code></p>
<p>Don’t forget to bump the version number after branching off!</p>
<p>Then, fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits.</p>
<p><code><br>$ git commit -m “Fixed severe production problem”<br>[hotfix-1.2.1 abbe5d6] Fixed severe production problem<br>5 files changed, 32 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)<br></code></p>
<h4 id="Finishing-a-hotfix-branch"><a href="#Finishing-a-hotfix-branch" class="headerlink" title="Finishing a hotfix branch"></a>Finishing a hotfix branch</h4><p>When finished, the bugfix needs to be merged back into master, but also needs to be merged back into develop, in order<br>to safeguard that the bugfix is included in the next release as well. This is completely similar to how release branches are<br>finished.</p>
<p>First, update master and tag the release.</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout master<br>Switched to branch ‘master’<br>$ git merge –no-ff hotfix-1.2.1<br>Merge made by recursive.<br>(Summary of changes)<br>$ git tag -a 1.2.1<br></code></p>
<p>Edit: You might as well want to use the -s or -u <key> flags to sign your tag cryptographically.</key></p>
<p>Next, include the bugfix in develop, too:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git checkout develop<br>Switched to branch ‘develop’<br>$ git merge –no-ff hotfix-1.2.1<br>Merge made by recursive.<br>(Summary of changes)<br></code></p>
<p>The one exception to the rule here is that, <strong>when a release branch currently exists, the hotfix changes need to be merged into that<br>release branch, instead of develop.</strong> Back-merging the bugfix into the release branch will eventually result in the bugfix being<br>merged into develop too, when the release branch is finished. (If work in develop immediately requires this bugfix and cannot wait<br>for the release branch to be finished, you may safely merge the bugfix into develop now already as well.)</p>
<p>Finally, remove the temporary branch:</p>
<p><code><br>$ git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1<br>Deleted branch hotfix-1.2.1 (was abbe5d6).<br></code></p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>While there is nothing really shocking new to this branching model, the “big picture” figure that this post began with has turned<br>out to be tremendously useful in our projects. It forms an elegant mental model that is easy to comprehend and allows team members<br>to develop a shared understanding of the branching and releasing processes.</p>
